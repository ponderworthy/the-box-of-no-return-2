      Audio with a Side of MIDI on Linux, Basic Setup</h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p> To build a synthesizer, we have to have </p>
    <p>need a way to take the output of synthesis routines, and mix and match
      audio streams with filters, effects, and other useful bits. In Linux, Jack
      Audio has long been the standard way to connect synths and filters and
      DAWs together with audio hardware; it works very well once set up. MIDI
      control has two very current standards: ALSA MIDI (MIDI through ALSA, ALSA
      being the most common Linux sound driver system, included in kernels), and
      Jack MIDI, where transport and connection runs through Jack Audio.</p>
    <br>
    For quite a number of years, I used ALSA MIDI in my setups, principally
    because of very wide recommendation from friends, from acquaintances, and in
    much documentation. But I noticed a peculiar problem occurring more and
    more: USB MIDI devices were recognized always, but increasingly were not
    able to be connected to any software right after reboot, until physically
    disconnected and reconnected. I actually wore out all of the USB ports on my
    box over a couple of years, unplugging and replugging. (Replaced them with
    FrontX parts and a PCI USB card.) I found a large number of reports of this
    problem and others like it, with no solutions; I also asked for and received
    diagnostic help from a number of very capable Linux coders who knew a lot
    more than I did…also without solution. The problem was visible through three
    very different distributions, six significantly different kernels native and
    custom-compiled, and two different USB MIDI interfaces. Then I happened to
    notice that all of the documentation I was using was at least two years old,
    and much of it older. So I turned off ALSA MIDI altogether, and set up Jack
    MIDI. You can guess what happened then.<br>
    <br>
    I try not to burrow too far into why it works, once I have something good
    and solid in my hands. Below is an outline of what is working very well for
    me now and a way to set it up for yourself. This is also the preliminary
    needed for Patch Management.<br>
    <br>
    I do recommend that you read Choosing a Linux Platform for Live Synth first;
    if you don't, you may be disappointed increasingly as you continue :-)<br>
    <br>
    Jack Audio<br>
    <br>
    Most computer audio needs are very simple: software makes streams of numbers
    which define sounds, so we need to send them to the speakers. Or software
    wants a working microphone, so we need to activate the one we have and get
    its input. In the common situations it's just a simple send out and/or slurp
    in, with just a few options and choices additional. But when we talk about
    synthesis and other more sophisticated things, we must tread much more
    carefully: we have tools which generate streams, tools which alter audio
    signals (filters), recording tools which can admit of as many inputs as we
    have different generating and filtering tools, and many more, and we need to
    be able to connect them all to each other, in the way they need to be for
    our particular task at hand. For this, on Linux, we use Jack Audio.<br>
    <br>
    First Check the Basic Facts!<br>
    <br>
    Before we start, we do need to get some basics squared away.<br>
    <br>
    First of all, a working Linux. Choosing the platform and setting it up well
    is absolutely necessary. Be happy with your hardware, OS, and working tools
    first.<br>
    <br>
    And second, if you are going to use built-in audio on a laptop, motherboard
    audio on a desktop, or PCI or PCI-E audio, you do need to have basic audio
    working before we start :-) When you tell your PC to play a WAV or MP3, it
    needs to play it! If not, you have something basic – hardware issue,
    hardware/kernel compatibility, distro issue – to solve first. At this level
    differences between distributions really stand out, and I'll have to refer
    you to the documentation for your distro to get this figured out…or you
    might do as I have done, which is to find a distro which works well with
    your audio first, or buy an audio card known to work well with what you are
    doing :-)<br>
    <br>
    We do have a happy exception in Firewire devices. The others – USB, PCI, and
    PCI-E audio interfaces – work with ALSA, “Advanced Linux Sound
    Architecture”, the kernel-level Linux audio system. Firewire devices don't,
    and in consequence using them can be much simpler. There are also
    architectural reasons why Firewire works extremely well and
    straightforwardly. If you have a Firewire device, do a bit of web-searching
    to find two people reporting that it works well with Linux, and don't worry
    about your system audio, you won't need it.<br>
    <br>
    Pulse and Desktop Audio Bleeps and Bloops: Disable, Remove<br>
    <br>
    PulseAudio is a background process standard to many Linux desktop installs.
    It does a lot of good in the general desktop audio milieu, because it
    handles that common situation where the desktop UI and one or more apps all
    need to beep and hum at the same time :-) It does other things too, e.g.,
    mixing different kinds of audio streams together in a very reliable fashion,
    and mirroring sound to multiple sound systems including to other machines
    over the network; and there are effects and other things one can do too.<br>
    <br>
    And yes, there are ways in recent production for Jack and Pulse to coexist.
    But they all increase complication and eat CPU, and CPU is precious in the
    live synth. The goal here is a hardened, reliable, bulletproof setup for
    audio synthesis, one where no interference will the primary function will be
    tolerated. So turn off any desktop environmental noisemakers, including all
    noisemaking by your desktop environment (Gnome, KDE, etc.), and do the
    following to get rid of Pulse:<br>
    <br>
    First, check in an xterm:<br>
    <br>
    ps aux | grep -i pulseaudio<br>
    If anything shows up besides the grep process, we turn it off.<br>
    <br>
    echo autospawn=no &gt; ~/.pulse/client.conf<br>
    pulseaudio -k<br>
    Happily, as of this writing (July 2015), the MATE edition of Debian Jessie
    makes it easy, you just remove the PulseAudio package! Thanks, guys!!!<br>
    <br>
    Install Jack2 and QjackCTL<br>
    <br>
    QjackCTL is probably the easiest tool with which to tweak, learn to tweak,
    and verify the Jack Audio setup that we need for the hardware at hand. Some
    distros are including it and some version of Jack at first install. There
    are two competing versions of Jack right now, sometimes called Jack1 and
    Jack2; I use Jack2 because its architecture was completely rewritten to make
    best use of multiple CPU cores. There are also often more than one type of
    jack2 install available; if there is a choice in a new build, I try the DBus
    version first, because I find it to be very nicely automate-able: best for
    reading and handling of the automation code, and best for general
    interoperability with other parts of the system. However, qjackctl itself
    has very mature abilities to automate the starting of JACK, and so if you
    find the DBus automation not suiting you for any reason, simply using your
    desktop autostart to initiate qjackctl remains a very good option.<br>
    <br>
    Configuration<br>
    <br>
    So we run qjackctl now, and unless configuration of some sort has already
    happened, we get something very close to this:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You'll notice that it says that it is stopped. qjackctl is a front end, a
    configurator, for the jackd audio transport process which runs invisibly. In
    its default setup jackd usually is turned off until needed. We'll leave it
    like this until we are ready to do differently: we want it well-configured
    for the hardware, before we set it to run all the time.<br>
    <br>
    Choose Audio Hardware in QjackCTL<br>
    <br>
    Click on Setup. You'll see something very like the below. If it's not, make
    it so. If you are using a Firewire audio device, “Driver” is set to
    “firewire”, and “Periods/buffer” is 3. It is said that USB has to use a
    Periods/buffer of 3 as well, but I have not found this to always be the
    case.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Latency Report in QjackCTL<br>
    <br>
    Study the image just above on this page. Notice that number at the lower
    right, 46.4 ms for ALSA and more for firewire. That's the barest minimum
    amount of time it takes between audio input and audio output in the current
    Jack configuration – and it's also the barest minimum amount of time,
    possibly doubled, between a MIDI input event and a note output event in our
    synth.<br>
    <br>
    So we have a goal we have to reach: in my experience, to be practical in
    live music, we have to get that number to less than 10 ms, and preferably
    less. This can take the sound system and CPU itself to their limits and
    past. We're not going to change it now – not until testing is complete – but
    it's rather good to know where we are going, no?<br>
    <br>
    Start Jack for the First Time<br>
    <br>
    A good first step to configure jack, is to see what we already have. So
    click Start. If Jack will run in its default condition, we'll get very close
    to this:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You'll notice that although the yellow is started, the green is still
    stopped. This is because the yellow represents audio transport – and the
    jackd process itself – but the green represents something else, one of the
    other functions of jackd, which is time-stamp transport. The idea behind
    time-stamp transport is to enable absolute synchronization of multiple audio
    tracks and video et cetera. We won't be worrying about that here, but
    beware, some folks call time-stamp transport just “transport”, which can get
    awfully confusing.<br>
    <br>
    If It Didn't Start<br>
    <br>
    Then you definitely have one or more problems to address immediately. You
    don't need the “realtime” checkmark for initial testing, so make sure that
    is unchecked.<br>
    <br>
    Firewire<br>
    <br>
    You'll want to make sure it's plugged in, powered up, and any status lights
    appropriate. This is where rubber hits the road, where you learn whether
    your code base (your distro and anything you have added) will support your
    hardware. This is also where the profound value of the Linux community may
    become obvious! Google it, find the people who are doing what you are
    trying. Perhaps like you found this web page :-)<br>
    <br>
    ALSA<br>
    <br>
    By far the most common problem I have seen at this point, has to do with
    ALSA sound card numbering.<br>
    <br>
    ALSA, the default sound system in today's Linux, gives each “sound card” it
    knows about, its own number. There are also items within cards, but it is
    this first sound card number which can be quite troublesome, because without
    some cryptic configuration, the default ALSA sound card for all audio for
    any system, is whatever it has decided should be labelled card 0, which
    could easily be the HDMI audio port on your video card, any of the two or
    three USB MIDI ports you are using…et cetera. The numbers start from zero.
    To see your current assignments, do this:<br>
    <br>
    cat /proc/asound/cards<br>
    On one very tweaked box, the result looked like this:<br>
    <br>
    [username@SROII ~]$ cat /proc/asound/cards<br>
    &nbsp;0 [NVidia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]: HDA-Intel
    - HDA NVidia<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    HDA NVidia at 0xdfe78000 irq 20<br>
    &nbsp;1
    [MO8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]:
    USB-Audio - YAMAHA MO8<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Yamaha YAMAHA MO8 at usb-0000:01:0a.1-1, full speed<br>
    [username@SROII ~]$ <br>
    The most important items for the moment, are the short canonical names of
    the the audio equipment being reported. These are, in this case, “NVidia”
    and “MO8”. Notice that a non-audio-device (MIDI only) is being listed by
    ALSA as a sound card; in point of fact, if MO8 were set as ALSA default, a
    (very brief) attempt would be made by many sound apps to use it as the
    standard audio output device. But we're in the Jack world now, not the Pulse
    world or the pure-ALSA world; we need to have Jack take over the one we want
    (NVidia), and have anything we use, connect to Jack or stay out of our way.<br>
    <br>
    So. In the “Interface” field in qjackctl configuration as shown above, you
    can optionally type in text. I always use the short name rather than the
    number, and it's done like this:<br>
    <br>
    hw:NVidia<br>
    So type in the short name of the audio device you have, and try it again. If
    it starts, you're ready to start tuning; if not, there are other problems.
    You can keep the “Realtime” item UNchecked while at this phase. There is an
    excellent test applet available here and a whole lot of detail using the
    above and other methods here, but these are generally reserved for after
    this step is complete. They can help you find issues discussed above which
    you may have missed, most especially any background processes which may be
    stealing the sound card from Jack.<br>
    <br>
    But usually, in my several experiences so far, if sound worked out of the
    box and Jack doesn't start at all now, at the very high-tolerance,
    high-latency (46ms!) configuration pictured above, which has so much
    buffering that we can't use it for live work at all, it means that you're
    using sound hardware which just doesn't cut the mustard for this work.<br>
    <br>
    It Started!<br>
    <br>
    Excellent; we hit the ball, and now we'll start to see if our legs know how
    to run :-)<br>
    <br>
    Now we need something which will actually deliver some audio to Jack, to
    send through the sound system. Install Yoshimi, and with Jack running, run
    yoshimi in a command shell thusly:<br>
    <br>
    yoshimi -j -J -K<br>
    The -j ensures that Yoshimi will connect to Jack for MIDI; the -J specifies
    Jack for audio, and the -K tells Yoshimi to automatically tell Jack to
    connect it to the sound system for output. When it comes up, turn up the
    main volume at the upper right, click the Instrument menu and then Virtual
    Keyboard, and try some notes. If you get the pure sine tones of the
    patch-less configuration, that is just right.<br>
    <br>
    Getting There<br>
    <br>
    So we have a nice, low-demand sine tone, on demand. That's excellent…of
    course if we wanted a sine tone, we would be better off buying an electronic
    tuner…or blowing across a bottle :-) And we're still running at high
    latency, we're not close to playable yet.<br>
    <br>
    So the next step is to start pushing it. Close Yoshimi first. In your
    QjackCTL setup, set your frames/period to 64 (default being 1024!), and
    periods/buffer at 2 unless your sound system is USB, if it's USB you need
    periods/buffer at 3. Set your sample rate at 44100 for this step. Then close
    and save, and stop and restart Jack, and start Yoshimi again as above. Try
    it and see what happens.<br>
    <br>
    You may well be able to push it all the way to frames/period of 32 without
    issues. Or you might try a sample rate of 48000; that will reduce your
    latency to just within useful levels, if your sound system does 48000 very
    well (as many do now). But more than likely, especially when you start
    loading complex patches in Yoshimi and flipping that mouse across the
    virtual keyboard, you'll start to find QJackCTL freezing up, or these:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Those red numbers represent “xruns”. They happen when your setup cannot
    handle the demands of what you are trying to do. Very often this occurs as a
    result of desktop extras – PulseAudio, automount of USB flash drives, other
    things. But core hardware capacity factors into it just as much. If your CPU
    is too occupied with the number-crunching which your setup is demanding, it
    may not have enough left to give to kick that stream towards the output in
    the smooth and clean manner which is required.<br>
    <br>
    Now I have to admit that I cheated just a bit in creating the above image: I
    made it on this laptop I'm typing into right now, not my production box. But
    this laptop is a dual-core Intel with 3G RAM: rebuilt from junk yes, quite a
    few years old plus yes, but still a dual-core Intel with lots of RAM, and
    yet I cannot push this hardware even close. Even using a nice USB sound
    dongle. Haven't tried firewire on it yet, but the point is, here is where
    you learn whether or not your hardware and OS configuration has what it
    takes. In the case of this laptop, I spent quite a lot of time and effort
    trying stripped-down distro after stripped-down distro, because I have lots
    of reports that dual-core/3G is great for this purpose; but there must be
    something about the chipset which just does not let the good times roll. If
    I ever need it badly enough, I'll get a fireware card for it and try that
    route.<br>
    <br>
    Anyhow, if at this point, you are seeing lots of xruns on ample hardware,
    it's time to start tuning and tweaking. Rare xruns – one every 5-15 minutes
    – can be OK in production, but beware, some xrun causes will send pops and
    even static into your input stream.<br>
    <br>
    Tuning and Tweaking for Latency<br>
    <br>
    There are a large number of things which can be done to get your machine to
    function with usable latencies – remember, you'll need about 10ms and
    preferably less. The best test utility I know of is here:<br>
    <br>
    https://github.com/raboof/realtimeconfigquickscan#readme<br>
    <br>
    and the best guide I've seen to the above, with other methods, is here:<br>
    <br>
    http://www.wiki.linuxmusicians.com/doku.php?id=system_configuration<br>
    <br>
    You will notice discussion of “real-time kernels”. This is not necessary as
    long as one's hardware is recent and powerful. It's also not an extremely
    simple process. But if you have time, patience, and motivation, the result
    is smoother operation; the best thing to do is to use the procedure specific
    to your distribution.<br>
    <br>
    Let's Look at the MIDI<br>
    <br>
    So now we have pleasing tones coming out of Yoshimi without xruns (or at
    least very many), and it's time to start getting the MIDI working. In
    QjackCTL again, click the Connect button, and you'll get something like
    this:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You'll notice how Yoshimi automatically connected itself to the system
    output, because of the command-line arguments given above (-j -J -K). You
    will also notice two more tabs: MIDI, and ALSA. We need to talk about that
    right now.<br>
    <br>
    Jack MIDI, ALSA MIDI, Et Cetera<br>
    <br>
    There are two standards very common for MIDI on Linux right now. One is
    usually called Jack MIDI, and the other ALSA MIDI. Jack MIDI is built into
    the same Jack system we're using for audio; the other is at a lower level,
    the ALSA sound driver level.<br>
    <br>
    One can find lots and lots of input on the web as to which to use and why.
    Here are my experiences and suggestions therefrom.<br>
    <br>
    For at least two years, I used ALSA MIDI exclusively, as a result of reading
    multiple web sites' advice citing compatibility, latency, et cetera. At
    first it worked gloriously, but quickly I ran into a problem: I was required
    to plug in my MIDI ports after booting the box up and starting Jack, and not
    before. If I powered up everything, MIDI did not work, until I unplugged my
    USB MIDI adapter or USB MIDI keyboard and immediately replugged. I found
    lots of forum posts reporting the problem, with absolutely no solutions. It
    appears that not all hardware has this problem; in particular, unless I
    mistake much collective readings, if one has a sound card with MIDI built
    in, this problem does not seem to show up. But I ended up wearing out every
    USB port on my box with the unplugging/replugging!!! I replaced them, but
    did not want to do that again.<br>
    <br>
    So I tried Jack MIDI. Problem vanished. But it is different, and it has to
    be done correctly.<br>
    <br>
    Setting Up Jack MIDI<br>
    <br>
    In ALSA MIDI, everything software sets up quite easily. Here's how it looks
    with Yoshimi run in ALSA MIDI mode (-a -J -K), the connection was manually
    set:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    And here's what we have in Jack MIDI (yoshimi -j -J -K):<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You'll notice that yoshimi is perfectly happy to accept Jack MIDI – but
    where's the hardware? Well, for that we need to change the Setup in
    QjackCTL, thusly:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    With this in place (and don't forget to stop and restart Yoshimi and Jack),
    you'll get this:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    and then you can connect to your heart's content :-) “System” represents all
    hardware. It becomes easy to click the top-level item on the left, and
    everything you want to which you want to send MIDI on the right, and click
    Connect. Then try it, and enjoy!<br>
    <br>
    Additional MIDI Options<br>
    <br>
    There are other things useful to know about MIDI. Jack can be set for “raw”
    MIDI mode instead of seq; this is reportedly helpful in some circumstances,
    though I haven't found them yet. But the more significant circumstance is
    applications which do not have a jack-MIDI mode, which can accept MIDI input
    only through ALSA MIDI. For these, we install a neat utility called
    a2jmidid. It can be run like this:<br>
    <br>
    a2j_control start<br>
    and it will put a top-level item called “a2j” to the Jack MIDI connections
    area, containing a copy of all ALSA MIDI software ports. If<br>
    <br>
    a2j_control ehw<br>
    is run before starting a2j, hardware is put there too.<br>
    <br>
    Once You're There<br>
    <br>
    This document produces a result very useful for the studio, especially when
    you may be setting it up differently for every excursion. But eventually you
    will probably find that you keep on setting up the same setups over and over
    again; after all, they don't remain after you power down. There are several
    ways of storing sets of prebuilt setups, some of them GUI. However, when I
    play I do not want distraction from the music, and I have not found any of
    the systems out there ready for my needs.<br>
    <br>
    For a number of years, I set up Robust Session Management. But there were
    disadvantages, and eventually the opportunity arose to acquire some major
    hardware; and then something new arose: Concurrent Patch Management. If I
    were doing studio, or needed to use lesser hardware, R.S.M. would still
    serve well; but C.P.M. has been serving very well for quite some time now,
    highly recommendable.<br>
    <br>

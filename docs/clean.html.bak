    <h2>the situation</h2>
    <p>This is a topic I have hesitated to write about for a long time. Mostly
      this is because when I posted questions about this to the often helpful <a
        href="https://lists.linuxaudio.org/listinfo/linux-audio-user">Linux
        Audio Users</a> group, I found that many people don't experience this at
      all, they just plug everything in and go. However, in all of my
      developments, I have had a whole lot of trouble with hiss, and hum, and
      crackle, and other unwanted sounds mixed in with my desired output. Here
      is a discussion of what I have encountered and what I have done about it.</p>
    <h2>approaches</h2>
    <p>This cleanup has been one of the most stubborn problems I have had in the
      whole effort. I have studied hundreds of pages of professional guides, as
      well as direct input from professionals, and I have added grounding wires
      left and right and upside down, and run the whole rig through
      medical-grade transformer isolation, and more, without resolution. So
      given the utter failure of so much professional input, I have ceased
      trying to respect logic of causality, and contented myself with the
      factual solutions below.</p>
    <h2>part I: the AC power vector</h2>
    <p>One “vector”, or path, by which the gunk gets in, is clearly the AC
      power. This is obvious by recognition of sixty-cycle (in most places in
      the world, it would be fifty-cycle) hum. But this is not all. In many
      places I need to play there are lighting systems which dump other gunk
      into the AC power line, and more; and all of this tends to show up in the
      BNR audio signal. One would think that transformer isolation of the whole
      playing rig would fix it, and this might work – except that I usually need
      to play through a PA, and covering everything isn't practical.</p>
    <p>Happily, I found a great way to eliminate this, the <a href="http://www.ebtechaudio.com/humxdes.html">Ebtech
        Hum Exterminator</a> or Hum X for short. I own four of these things now,
      and will not be without them by choice, they are fantastic.</p>
    <h2>part II: the USB vector</h2>
    <p>The second major class of gunk, is USB signals. I spent a ridiculous
      amount of time trying to figure out how this was happening; it happens
      whether I use USB MIDI interfaces or USB direct to the keyboard. If
      firewire is in use, there may be firewire gunk too. We can tell this is
      happening, if (for instance) gunk gets into the audio whenever a USB mouse
      moves, or a USB keyboard is typed on…!</p>
    <p>I have tested a number of different signal filters against this problem.
      I was using Behringer HD400's, but I had two of them die in unexpected
      manner, so I moved to <a href="http://www.rolls.com/product.php?pid=HE18">Rolls
        HE18 Buzz Off</a> devices, and these have been the best of all, also
      best in both price and in build quality.</p>
    <h2>part III: The PC Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>The third class I have had to deal with, I'm calling The PC
      Miscellaneous, so far it's been case fans and CPU fans. We can verify the
      existence of this, simply by disconnecting a case fan (or just stopping
      one with a finger!) and hearing a buzz go away.</p>
    <p>I have no idea why this happened or why I haven't seen reports of it
      elsewhere, but I knocked out the issue mostly with the tools in the above
      sections, I did add a speed control to one of the case fans. I received a
      lot of advice while working on it, often involving making sure everything
      is grounded; it always was and is, this is a steel case and a good
      metal-cased power supply.</p>
    <h2>postscript</h2>
    <p>One of the reasons it seemed very good to write up this page, is the
      recent production by Peavey of their <a href="https://peavey.com/products/index.cfm/item/875/117099">USB-P</a>;
      it is explicitly designed for this sort of use case (!), incorporates
      signal cleanup circuitry with isolation, and is highly recommended in this
      very way in reviews on certain major Internet retailers.&nbsp; It works
      extremely well in noisy circumstances, I did not need my Rolls with it;
      but unfortunately it only runs to 48 kHz.&nbsp; My new Mackie Onyx Artist
      doesn't have XLR outputs, but does put out the cleanest, most beautiful
      tone I have ever heard, as long as my Rolls is on the output!</p>

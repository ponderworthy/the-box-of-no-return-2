    <h2>summary</h2>

    <p>The Box of No Return III is a Linux-based musical synthesizer platform,
      suitable for live musicianship, designed to handle multiple patches with
      enormous demands, and switch between them with zero delay and zero
      cutout.&nbsp; If you sit in your home studio and use single SoundFonts
      with a laptop and simple GUI, you don't need this.&nbsp; If you play live,
      and/or if you want to pile on the tone generators and filters in order
      to experience the unyielding power of the musical harmonic roar, a
      full implementation of the BNR may suit you well.&nbsp; There are
      obviously middle grounds too â˜º, and there are articles here to help in
      general.  

    <h2>the purpose of this project</h2>
    
    <p>The BNR exists to apply major computing power available, to music tone generation.  We 
    don't want to be limited to the cute little processors in commercial keyboards.  The 
    available difference is so great between the two, that we should be able to produce subjective
    multiple orders of magnitude increase in tonal depth and profundity, using what we have
    available in general desktop computing hardware, especially running Linux, where we are
    at least potentially less limited.  And this will.</p>
    
    <h2>the code</h2>

    <p>The project and its code are <a href="https://github.com/ponderworthy/the-box-of-no-return-3"
        target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; There are SF2 SoundFonts
      involved in the current build which are downloadable <a href="https://archive.org/details/SonatinaSymphonicOrchestraSF2"
        target="_blank">here</a>; these are conversions of the Sonatina
      Symphonic Orchestra, original SFZs being <a href="http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/download.html"
        target="_blank">here</a>. Friend Bruce Schultz recently pointed out that two SF2s are missing, 
        and these are now <A HREF="https://mega.nz/folder/xl4nACqb#l1tXws-wSYIX59PEDztjiA">here.</A></p>
        
    <h2>current status</h2>
    
    <p>We have the Supermega Rumblic Organ which uses six Yoshimi patches spread over three
    independent Yoshimi processes.  The Strings are massive and deep in the low, and feathery in the high, using
    a large number of different SoundFonts combined into one SF2 with other SF2's running at the same time.
    And Flowbells are smooooth.  There are ways to combine them too.</p>
    
    <h2>a summary of how</h2>
    
    <p>First we set up a good Linux distro like Manjaro which does both Pipewire and major Linux audio 
    applications, on good PC hardware, say a quad-core at 3.3GHz or so, better obviously better.  
    Then we get audio to work well using Pipewire.  Then, we clone this whole repository into 
    a folder called BNR, in the user home folder of an automatically logging-in user.  
    There's a number of software tools you'll need to add, there's a list below.  
    Then we take a MIDI keyboard, and plug it in using a USB MIDI interface.  
    It's breathtaking once you get it all running.  Here's the list.  Some may already be present,
    and some may be a bit tough to get in.  You can certainly substitute; obviously, if you do,
    you'll need to customize the "glue" accordingly.</p>
    
    <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="https://yoshimi.sourceforge.io/">Yoshimi</A>, a blow-your-doors-off software synthesizer.</LI>
    <LI>fluidsynth, a very capable SF2 SoundFont host and player.</LI>
    <LI>Calf Studio Gear, for reverb and other audio signal processing, and more; often called 'calf' 
    or 'calf-plugins', depending on distro.</LI>
    <LI>mididings, for MIDI signal processing and rewriting.  Missing and out of date in a number of distros 
    recently, it is most elegant and efficient.  Its originator has been not found for quite some time, but 
    there are many forks on Github, and <A HREF="https://github.com/ponderworthy/mididings">ours 
    compiles and runs well</A> in the most current Python (as of this writing).</LI>
    <LI>non-mixer, a most profoundly excellent mixer and effects host for JACK audio streams.</LI>
    <LI>lxterminal, a lightweight, very reliable terminal.</LI>
    <LI>helvum, for Pipewire wiring visuals.  May have to be compiled <A HREF="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/helvum">from source</A>, depending on distro.</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <p>On your MIDI keyboard, you'll need
    to find out how to get the MIDI keyboard to send MIDI note-events and sustain-pedal-events out, and how
    to set the channel; all MIDI-capable keyboards have had the ability to do this for quite a few decades.
    Once you have done this, and the BNR is hot, if you send your note-events on channel 1 you get 
    the Supermega Rumblic Organ, on channel 2 you get Strings, and more; look in the source for 
    <A HREF="https://github.com/ponderworthy/the-box-of-no-return-3/blob/main/Distribute.py">Distribute.py</A>
    for the more, it is the applet which controls the translation.  Each one of the patches is 
    a combination of tone generation applications and other applications to mix and modify
    their signals, all connected by Pipewire.</p>
    
    <h2>architecture</h2>

    <p>To connect audio applications in series, in other words to make either a synthesizer or
    audio processor in Linux, one must use something which can accept and maintain "wires", connections,
    between the applications.  For twenty-plus years the most standard way to do this
    has been JACK, which stands for the Jack Audio Connection Kit.  This is still the most common
    standard as of this writing. The previous iteration of the BNR used multiple JACK processes in tandem, 
    because the one JACK process used in the original (in standard fashion), often crashed under 
    the strain. Iteration III uses Pipewire as its foundation, for a quite drastic increase in 
    performance.  Pipewire is API-agnostic, it will interconnect any of the current common 
    audio APIs in Linux, e.g., JACK, ALSA, Pulse, et cetera, and it will handle demands in 
    a very non-round-robin manner, producing a startlingly 
    flexible result.  BNR III still does use the JACK API for many good reasons, ranging from 
    toolset to just plain excellence in this and similar modes, but it is
    Pipewire responding now and keeping the wiring.</p>
    
    <h2>postscript</h2>

    <p>Many prayers granted, enormous help from the Linux Audio community, and
      much study, work, and trial and error, has gone into making this happen
      reliably and well.&nbsp; My gratitude to all!</p>
